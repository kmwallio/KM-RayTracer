An example ray tracing program written in Perl for CSE 4280 (Graphical Algorithms).  This program demonstrates how ray tracing can be used to generate a "3-D Image" by tracing a ray and calculating intersections of mathematical objects in space.

## Requirements

* Gtk2-Perl

## Other Notes

This program was tested on Debian 5 (Lenny).  Perl and Gtk2-Perl should be installed by default on Debian and/or Ubuntu.
